title: Sponsor & support the NetDaemon project
---


NetDeamon has been a passion project, crafted by a small yet dedicated team along with the invaluable support of our fantastic community.

NetDeamon will always be free and will be continued to be released with nothing less than "MIT" licensing. However if you're as fond of NetDeamon as we are and would like to express your appreciation through a small donation, please consider using one of the links below.

Your contribution will go towards covering essential infrastructure costs such as hosting fees and the like.
